# Express-Webserver  
## Goal  
- Setup simple hello-world node.js deploy on Docker container  
## Steps:  
1. Create app.js and package.json.  
App.js is the main module in a Node.js project. This file is used to initialize and set up the web application using a specific framework or library. App.js contains code to create a simple Express server that responds with the message "Hello World!" when a request is made to the root URL ('/').
Package.json is a configuration file for a Node.js project. It contains information about the project, the dependencies required by the project, and various scripts that can be executed using npm.
